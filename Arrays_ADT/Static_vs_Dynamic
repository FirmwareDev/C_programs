Static vs Dynamic Arrays:

void main()
{

	int A[5];   // array is created in stack, size of the memory is decided during compilation time

Note: In c++, sixe of an array can be decided in run-time and the array will be created inside the stack.

	inr *p;   // pointer variable, memory will be allocated in stack for this variable
	
	p = new int[5]; //c++ syntax, for dynamic memory allocation, i.e memory is allocated in heap.
	
	p = (int*) malloc(5* sizeof(int)); // C syntax, dynamic allocation
	
Note:
Memory allocated in heap should always be released, otherwise it causes "memory Leak" problems.

   delete [] p;  // in C++
   free(p);      // in C
